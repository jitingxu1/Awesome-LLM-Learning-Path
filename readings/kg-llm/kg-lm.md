    - Analyzing LLMs and providing interpretability
        - “Language models as knowledge bases?  F. Petroni, T. Rocktaschel, S. Riedel, P. Lewis, A. Bakhtin, Y. Wu, ¨and A. Miller.  pp. 2463–2473.
        - Kagnet: Knowledgeaware graph networks for commonsense reasoning,2019
        - Knowledge neurons in pretrained transformers, 2021
    - 
- LLM-augmented KGs

    - KGQA: Unikgqa: Unified retrieval and reasoning for solving multi-hop question answering
    over knowledge graph
- Synergized LLM + KG
    - researchers marries the merits of LLMs and KGs to mutually enhance performance in knowledge representation and reasoning
- knowledge-enhanced LLMs
    - using KGs as an external knowledge to enhance LLMs, they ignore other possibilities of integrating KGs for LLMs and the potential role of LLMs in KG applications
    

## Type of KG

- encyclopedic KGs
    - Derived from wikipedia: Wikidata, Freebase, Dbpedia, YAGO
    - WEB: NELL, continuously improving
    - Other language: Knowledge Occean (Chinese?), CN-DBpedia, Vikidia
- commonsense KG
    - ConceptNet: contains a wide range of common sense concepts and relations, which can help computers understand the meanings of words people use
    - ATOMIC and ASER: focus on the causal effects between events, which can be used for commonsense reasoning.
    - Some other commonsense knowledge graphs, such as TransOMCS and CausalBanK are automatically constructed to provide commonsense knowledge
- domain-specific KG
    - Medical: UMLS
    - Anticipating stock market of the renowned companies: a knowledge graph approach
    - Intelligent learning for knowledge graph towards geological data
    - Inference of biomedical relations among chemicals, genes, diseases, and symptoms using knowledge representation learning
    - Knowledge graph approach to combustion chemistry and interoperability
- multimodal KG: multi-modal knowledge graphs represent facts in multiple modalities such as images, sounds, and videos
    - IMGpedia and MMKG, Richpedia: image-text matching, visual question answering, recommendation
